## Course Overview

Graph Machine Learning is a branch of machine learning that deals with graph data.


## Prerequisites

- Knowledge of basic computer science principles, sufficient to write a reasonably non-trivial computer program.
- Familiarity with the basic probability theory
- Familiarity with the basic linear algebra


## Course Materials

The following books are recommended as optional reading:

- Graph Representation Learning by William L. Hamilton
- Networks, Crowds, and Markets: Reasoning About a Highly Connected World by David Easley and Jon Kleinberg
- Network Science by Albert-László Barabási

## Office Hours

Regular Office Hours: We will have office hours every day, starting from the 2nd week of the course. Office hours will be held over Zoom. These office hours are open to any enrolled students (including SCPD students).
Schedule and location: Check the calendar below. All the CAs will be holding their office hours through Zoom.
Queuing: We will be using QueueStatus to manage more efficiently the queue of students waiting for a CA.
Update: Based on student feedback, we have decided to hold in-person OHs on Wednesday 9 - 11 AM.


## Homework and assignments

## Honor Code and Submission Policy
The following paragraphs apply both to any material submitted for this course (homework, project proposal, project milestone, and so on).

Honor code: We strongly encourage students to form study groups. Students may discuss and work on homework problems in groups. However, each student must write down the solutions independently, and without referring to written notes from the joint session. In other words, each student must understand the solution well enough in order to reconstruct it by him/herself. In addition, each student should write on the problem set the group of people with whom she/he collaborated.

Further, since we occasionally reuse problem set questions from previous years, we expect students not to copy, refer to, or look at the solutions in preparing their answers. It is an honor code violation to intentionally refer to a previous year's solutions or code. This applies both to the official solutions and to solutions that you or someone else may have written up in a previous year.

Finally, we consider it an Honor Code Violation to post your homework solutions to a place where it is easy for other students to access it. This includes uploading your solutions to publicly-viewable repositories like on GitHub.

The standard penalty for a first offense includes a one-quarter suspension from the University and 40 hours of community service. And the standard penalty for multiple violations (e.g., cheating more than once in the same course) is a three-quarter suspension and 40 or more hours of community service. Stanford Office of Community Standards contains more information.

Late submissions: Each student will have a total of two late periods to use for homework/colabs and project proposal (NOT the final project report, for which the deadline is strict.) One late period expires midnight on the day before the next class: this means that if the assignment is due on Thursday then the first late period expires at 11:59pm on the next Monday. Once late periods are exhausted, any write-up turned in late will be penalized 50% per late period. However, no write-up (homework and project related documents) will be accepted more than one late period after its due date.

Please start submitting to Gradescope 30 minutes before the deadline. In previous quarters, Gradescope has been very unresponsive at midnight. In case you cannot successfully submit before 11:59pm, we will offer a 15 minute grace period to submit your assignment. This is a hard deadline and we will accept no assignments after this time.

## Exam


## Grading
The grading will be based on the following weighting scheme:

25% on 3 Homework (8.3% each)
20% on 5 Colabs (4% each)
35% on the Exam
20% on the Final Project
Course participation (Ed Discussion, code contributions, etc.) as extra credit
