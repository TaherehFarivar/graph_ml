## :bulb: Course Overview

<div align="justify">
  
*Graph Machine Learning* is a course that focuses on the application of machine learning algorithms on graph-structured data. Some of the key topics that are covered in the course include graph representation learning and graph neural networks, algorithms for the world wide web, reasoning over knowledge graphs, and social network analysis. The course is designed for graduate students with a background in machine learning and/or data science who want to expand their skills to work with graph data. The course may also be useful for students and professionals working in fields such as computer science, biology, chemistry, and physics that require the analysis of graph-structured data. The objective of the course is to provide students with a comprehensive understanding of graph machine learning and its various applications, challenges, and opportunities, as well as hands-on experience in implementing these algorithms.

### :copyright: Honor Code and Submission Policy

In the Graph Machine Learning course, the Honor Code and Submission Policy serve as the foundation for ethical and academic standards. All students are expected to adhere to the Honor Code by not engaging in academic misconduct such as plagiarism or cheating on exams. The Submission Policy requires that all assignments are submitted on time, in the specified format, and accurately reflect the student's own work. Late submissions may be accepted with a penalty, as outlined in the policy. Failure to comply with the Honor Code and Submission Policy may result in consequences such as a reduced grade or failure in the course. It is the responsibility of all students to familiarize themselves with the Honor Code and Submission Policy and to maintain the highest level of academic integrity.


The following paragraphs apply both to any material submitted for this course (homework, project proposal, project milestone, and so on).

Honor code: We strongly encourage students to form study groups. Students may discuss and work on homework problems in groups. However, each student must write down the solutions independently, and without referring to written notes from the joint session. In other words, each student must understand the solution well enough in order to reconstruct it by him/herself. In addition, each student should write on the problem set the group of people with whom she/he collaborated.

Further, since we occasionally reuse problem set questions from previous years, we expect students not to copy, refer to, or look at the solutions in preparing their answers. It is an honor code violation to intentionally refer to a previous year's solutions or code. This applies both to the official solutions and to solutions that you or someone else may have written up in a previous year.

Finally, we consider it an Honor Code Violation to post your homework solutions to a place where it is easy for other students to access it. This includes uploading your solutions to publicly-viewable repositories like on GitHub.

The standard penalty for a first offense includes a one-quarter suspension from the University and 40 hours of community service. And the standard penalty for multiple violations (e.g., cheating more than once in the same course) is a three-quarter suspension and 40 or more hours of community service. Stanford Office of Community Standards contains more information.

Late submissions: Each student will have a total of two late periods to use for homework/colabs and project proposal (NOT the final project report, for which the deadline is strict.) One late period expires midnight on the day before the next class: this means that if the assignment is due on Thursday then the first late period expires at 11:59pm on the next Monday. Once late periods are exhausted, any write-up turned in late will be penalized 50% per late period. However, no write-up (homework and project related documents) will be accepted more than one late period after its due date.

Please start submitting to Gradescope 30 minutes before the deadline. In previous quarters, Gradescope has been very unresponsive at midnight. In case you cannot successfully submit before 11:59pm, we will offer a 15 minute grace period to submit your assignment. This is a hard deadline and we will accept no assignments after this time.
