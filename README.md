## :bulb: Course Overview

<div align="justify">
  
*Graph Machine Learning* is a course that focuses on the application of machine learning algorithms on graph-structured data. Some of the key topics that are covered in the course include graph representation learning and graph neural networks, algorithms for the world wide web, reasoning over knowledge graphs, and social network analysis. The course is designed for graduate students with a background in machine learning and/or data science who want to expand their skills to work with graph data. The course may also be useful for students and professionals working in fields such as computer science, biology, chemistry, and physics that require the analysis of graph-structured data. The objective of the course is to provide students with a comprehensive understanding of graph machine learning and its various applications, challenges, and opportunities, as well as hands-on experience in implementing these algorithms.
